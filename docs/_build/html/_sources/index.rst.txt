We also provide functions for :ref:`plotting` bias-related plots. 

Our long-term goal is to offer a set of techniques to easily measure and mitigate AI risks across five  areas: Bias, Efficacy, Robustness, Privacy and Explainability. This will allow a holistic assessment of AI systems. 

Installation
------------

You can install the library with `pip` using the following command:

.. code-block::

  pip install holisticai
